Module 1 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
---
---

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

### Key Concepts

- **Nodes**: Processes that perform computation
- **Topics**: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages
- **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication
- **Actions**: Goal-oriented communication with feedback
- **Parameters**: Configuration values that can be changed at runtime

### Why ROS 2?

ROS 2 addresses the limitations of ROS 1 by providing:

- Improved real-time support
- Better security features
- Multi-robot support
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Professional-grade quality

### Core Architecture

ROS 2 uses a DDS (Data Distribution Service) implementation for communication between nodes. This provides:

- Scalable communication
- Quality of Service (QoS) settings
- Reliable message delivery
- Language independence

### Getting Started with ROS 2

To begin working with ROS 2, you'll need to:

1. Install ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill recommended)
2. Set up your development workspace
3. Create your first ROS 2 package
4. Understand the build system (Colcon)

### Practical Applications

ROS 2 is used in various applications including:

- Autonomous vehicles
- Industrial robots
- Research platforms
- Service robots
- Humanoid robots

### Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure a ROS 2 environment
- Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes
- Implement topics, services, and actions
- Design robot applications using ROS 2
- Debug and profile ROS 2 applications
