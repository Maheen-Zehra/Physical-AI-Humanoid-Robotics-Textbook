Middleware for Robot Control
---
---

ROS 2 acts as a **middleware**, meaning it sits between hardware and software.

### Why Middleware Is Needed
Robots consist of:
- sensors
- actuators
- controllers
- AI models

Middleware ensures these components:
- communicate reliably
- remain loosely coupled
- scale across machines

### ROS 2 as Middleware
ROS 2 provides:
- real-time data exchange
- fault tolerance
- distributed execution
- hardware abstraction

For humanoid robots, middleware is essential to synchronize motion, perception, and reasoning.
