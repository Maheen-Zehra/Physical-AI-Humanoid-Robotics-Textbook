Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
---
---

URDF defines the **physical structure** of a robot.

### What URDF Describes
- links (rigid bodies)
- joints (movement)
- mass and inertia
- collision geometry

### Why URDF Matters for Humanoids
Humanoid robots must:
- balance
- walk
- manipulate objects

URDF ensures simulations and controllers understand the robot’s physical constraints.

URDF is used by:
- Gazebo
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- motion planners
