 ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
---
---

### Nodes
A **node** is a single-purpose program in ROS 2.

Examples:
- camera node
- navigation node
- motor controller

Nodes run independently and communicate through ROS interfaces.

---

### Topics
Topics use a **publish / subscribe** model.

- Sensors publish data
- Controllers subscribe to data
- No direct dependency between nodes

Example topics:
- `/camera/image`
- `/cmd_vel`

---

### Services
Services use a **request / response** model.

Used for:
- reset commands
- calibration
- mode switching

Together, nodes, topics, and services form the communication backbone of ROS 2.
