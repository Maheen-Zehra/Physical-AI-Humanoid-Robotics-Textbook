Bridging Python Agents Using rclpy
---
---

AI models do not control motors directly.

### rclpy
`rclpy` is the Python client library for ROS 2.

It allows Python-based AI agents to:
- publish movement commands
- subscribe to sensor data
- call services

### Control Flow
1. AI agent makes a decision
2. Decision is translated into motion
3. Command is published to ROS 2
4. Robot executes the command

This bridge connects the **digital brain** to the **physical body**.
