# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: A Comprehensive Guide

## Quarter Overview

Welcome to the comprehensive educational platform for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This course provides an in-depth exploration of the fundamental concepts, tools, and techniques required to understand and develop humanoid robotic systems.

### Course Structure

This course is organized into four comprehensive modules:

1. **Module 1: ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)** - Foundation for robotic systems
2. **Module 2: Gazebo Simulation Environment** - Physics-based simulation for robotics
3. **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Platform** - AI-powered robotics development
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems** - Advanced multimodal robotics

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Design and implement robotic systems using ROS 2
- Create realistic simulations with Gazebo
- Leverage NVIDIA Isaac for AI-powered robotics
- Develop multimodal systems that integrate vision, language, and action

This educational platform combines comprehensive documentation with an interactive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot. You can navigate through the course content using the sidebar and ask questions about the material using the chat widget.
