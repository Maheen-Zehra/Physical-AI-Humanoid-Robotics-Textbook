## Voice-to-Action Overview

Voice-to-Action systems allow robots to receive spoken commands and convert them into executable tasks.

Speech is the most natural interface for human-robot interaction.

---

## OpenAI Whisper

Whisper is a speech recognition model that converts audio into text with high accuracy.

It supports:
- Multiple languages
- Noisy environments
- Real-time transcription

---

## Speech Pipeline

A typical Voice-to-Action pipeline includes:
1. Audio capture
2. Speech-to-text transcription
3. Intent extraction
4. Task planning

---

## Integration with Robotics

Transcribed text is passed to an LLM for interpretation. The resulting plan is then executed by ROS 2 nodes controlling the robot.

This creates a seamless spoken interface for robots.
