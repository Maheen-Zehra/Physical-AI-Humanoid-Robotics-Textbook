Cognitive Planning with LLMs

## What is Cognitive Planning?

Cognitive planning is the ability of an AI system to break down high-level goals into actionable steps.

Example:
"Clean the room"

This command must be translated into multiple physical actions.

## Role of LLMs

Large Language Models act as **reasoning engines** that:
- Interpret user intent
- Generate task sequences
- Handle ambiguity

LLMs transform language into structured action plans.

## Task Decomposition

An example decomposition:
1. Identify dirty objects
2. Navigate to object
3. Grasp object
4. Place object correctly

Each step maps to ROS 2 actions.

## Safety and Constraints

Cognitive planners must:
- Respect physical constraints
- Avoid unsafe actions
- Handle unexpected failures

This ensures reliable autonomous behavior.
