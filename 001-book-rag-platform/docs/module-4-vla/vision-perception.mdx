## Role of Vision in VLA

Vision provides situational awareness. Without vision, robots cannot interact intelligently with the physical world.

---

## Visual Tasks

Common visual perception tasks include:
- Object detection
- Object classification
- Depth estimation
- Scene understanding

These tasks guide robotic decision-making.

---

## Computer Vision Models

Vision models are trained using:
- Real-world data
- Synthetic data from simulators
- Domain randomization

Vision outputs feed into planning and control systems.

---

## Perception-Action Loop

Vision continuously updates the robot’s understanding of the environment, enabling dynamic and adaptive behavior.
