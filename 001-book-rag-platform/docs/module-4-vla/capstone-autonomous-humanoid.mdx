Capstone — The Autonomous Humanoid
---
---

## Capstone Project Overview

The capstone project integrates all modules into a single autonomous humanoid system.

This project represents the culmination of Physical AI.

---

## System Pipeline

1. Voice command received
2. Speech converted to text
3. LLM generates action plan
4. Robot navigates environment
5. Objects are identified visually
6. Robot manipulates the object

---

## Simulation Environment

The humanoid operates in a simulated environment using:
- Gazebo
- Isaac Sim
- ROS 2

This allows safe testing before real-world deployment.

---

## Learning Outcomes

Students demonstrate:
- Embodied intelligence
- Autonomous decision-making
- Human-robot interaction

This project reflects real-world robotics systems used in industry and research.
