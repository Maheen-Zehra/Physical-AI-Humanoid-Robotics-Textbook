## Isaac ROS Overview

Isaac ROS is a collection of **GPU-accelerated ROS 2 packages** optimized for NVIDIA hardware. It enables high-performance perception and navigation.

Isaac ROS runs efficiently on:
- RTX GPUs
- NVIDIA Jetson devices

---

## Hardware Acceleration

Traditional ROS pipelines rely heavily on CPUs. Isaac ROS offloads computation to GPUs, enabling:
- Faster image processing
- Real-time SLAM
- Low-latency navigation

---

## Visual SLAM (VSLAM)

Visual SLAM allows a robot to:
- Build a map of the environment
- Localize itself within that map
- Navigate without GPS

VSLAM uses camera data instead of LiDAR, making it ideal for indoor humanoid robots.

## Perception Stack Components

Typical Isaac ROS pipelines include:
- Camera drivers
- Feature extraction
- Map generation
- Localization nodes

These components work together to provide spatial awareness.
