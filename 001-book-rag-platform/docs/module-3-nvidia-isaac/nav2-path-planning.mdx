Nav2 Path Planning for Humanoids
---
---

## Nav2 Overview

Nav2 is the ROS 2 navigation framework used for autonomous movement. It enables robots to plan paths, avoid obstacles, and reach goals safely.

Nav2 is widely used in mobile and humanoid robots.

## Path Planning Concepts

Path planning involves:
- Global planning (finding a route)
- Local planning (avoiding obstacles)
- Recovery behaviors

For humanoids, planning must account for balance and stability.

## Navigation for Bipedal Robots

Unlike wheeled robots, humanoids must:
- Maintain balance
- Handle uneven terrain
- Coordinate leg movement

Nav2 integrates with humanoid controllers to generate feasible movement paths.

## Integration with Perception

Nav2 relies on:
- VSLAM maps
- Sensor data
- Costmaps

Accurate perception ensures safe and efficient navigation.
