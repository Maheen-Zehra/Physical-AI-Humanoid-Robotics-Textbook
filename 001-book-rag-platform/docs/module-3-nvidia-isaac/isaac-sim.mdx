## NVIDIA Isaac Sim Overview

Isaac Sim is a **photorealistic robotics simulator** built on NVIDIA Omniverse. It is designed for training and testing AI-powered robots using realistic environments and physics.

Unlike basic simulators, Isaac Sim focuses on:
- Visual realism
- Synthetic data generation
- AI model training

## Photorealistic Simulation

Isaac Sim uses RTX ray tracing to generate realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections. This is critical for training vision models that must operate in real-world conditions.

Photorealism improves:
- Object detection accuracy
- Depth estimation
- Scene understanding

---

## Synthetic Data Generation

Synthetic data allows AI models to learn without collecting massive real-world datasets.

Isaac Sim can generate:
- Labeled images
- Segmentation masks
- Depth maps
- Bounding boxes

This data is used to train perception models efficiently.

## Sim-to-Real Transfer

Models trained in Isaac Sim can be deployed to real robots. Domain randomization techniques help reduce the gap between simulation and reality.
