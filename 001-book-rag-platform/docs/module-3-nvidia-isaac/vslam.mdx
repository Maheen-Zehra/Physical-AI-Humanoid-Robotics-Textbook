Visual SLAM for Humanoid Robots

## What is Visual SLAM?

Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) enables robots to understand where they are and what the environment looks like using visual data.

Unlike LiDAR-based SLAM, VSLAM relies on:
- RGB cameras
- Stereo vision
- Depth cameras

## Why VSLAM for Humanoids?

Humanoid robots often operate indoors where GPS is unavailable. VSLAM allows:
- Accurate indoor navigation
- Lightweight sensor setups
- Human-like perception

---

## Core VSLAM Processes

- Feature detection
- Frame-to-frame tracking
- Loop closure
- Map optimization

These processes run continuously as the robot moves.

## Challenges in VSLAM

- Lighting changes
- Motion blur
- Dynamic environments

GPU acceleration helps overcome these challenges by enabling faster computation.
