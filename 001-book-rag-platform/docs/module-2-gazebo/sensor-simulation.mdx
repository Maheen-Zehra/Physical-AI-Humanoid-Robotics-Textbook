## Importance of Sensor Simulation

Sensors allow robots to perceive the world. Accurate sensor simulation ensures AI models behave similarly in real environments.

Common humanoid sensors include:
- LiDAR
- Depth cameras
- IMUs

## LiDAR Simulation

LiDAR simulates laser scans to detect obstacles and measure distances. It is essential for:
- Mapping
- Navigation
- Obstacle avoidance

Simulated LiDAR generates point clouds similar to real hardware.

## Depth Cameras

Depth cameras provide:
- RGB images
- Distance information

They are used for:
- Object detection
- Scene understanding
- Manipulation tasks

Simulation must include noise and lighting effects for realism.

## IMU Simulation

IMUs measure:
- Orientation
- Acceleration
- Angular velocity

For humanoids, IMUs are critical for:
- Balance
- Walking stability
- Fall detection

Accurate IMU simulation supports better control algorithms.
