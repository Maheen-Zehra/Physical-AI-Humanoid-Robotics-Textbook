Introduction to Gazebo
---
---

Gazebo is a powerful 3D simulation environment for robotics that provides realistic physics simulation, high-quality graphics, and convenient programmatic interfaces. It plays a crucial role in the development and testing of robotic systems before deployment on real hardware.

## Core Features

- **Physics Engine**: Accurate simulation using ODE, Bullet, or DART
- **Sensor Simulation**: Cameras, LIDAR, IMU, GPS, and more
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible functionality through plugins
- **Multi-Robot Simulation**: Simultaneous simulation of multiple robots
- **Realistic Rendering**: High-quality 3D graphics

## Integration with ROS 2

Gazebo integrates seamlessly with ROS 2 through Gazebo ROS packages, which provide a bridge between Gazebo and ROS 2. This integration allows for:

- Direct loading of URDF robot descriptions
- ROS 2 message publishing from simulated sensors
- Joint and model control through ROS 2 topics and services
