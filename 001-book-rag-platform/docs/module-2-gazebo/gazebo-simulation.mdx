---

## Gazebo Overview

Gazebo is a robotics simulation platform designed to work closely with ROS 2. It provides:
- Realistic physics
- Sensor simulation
- Large-scale environments

Gazebo is commonly used to test robot behaviors before real deployment.

---

## Environment Setup

A Gazebo world can include:
- Floors and terrain
- Obstacles and objects
- Lighting and gravity settings

World files define environmental conditions and physics parameters.

---

## Robot Simulation in Gazebo

Robots are loaded into Gazebo using URDF or SDF descriptions. These files define:
- Robot geometry
- Joint constraints
- Mass and inertia
- Sensor placement

Gazebo communicates with ROS 2 nodes, allowing real controllers to operate simulated robots.

## Advantages of Gazebo
- Tight ROS 2 integration
- Accurate physics for robotics
- Ideal for navigation and manipulation testing
