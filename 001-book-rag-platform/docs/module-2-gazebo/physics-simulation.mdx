## Physics Simulation in Robotics

Physics simulation allows robots to behave realistically in a virtual environment. A simulation engine computes forces, motion, and interactions based on physical laws.

### Core Physics Concepts
- Gravity
- Mass and inertia
- Friction and damping
- Collisions and contact forces

In humanoid robots, accurate physics is critical for:
- Balance and walking
- Object manipulation
- Stability during movement

## Gravity and Dynamics

Gravity defines how a robot’s body responds to weight and balance. Incorrect gravity settings can cause:
- Floating robots
- Unstable walking
- Unrealistic falls

Dynamic simulation calculates how forces affect joints and links over time.

## Collisions and Contact Modeling

Collision detection prevents objects from passing through each other. Contact modeling determines:
- How hard objects collide
- How friction affects movement
- Whether a robot slips or stands firmly

Proper collision settings are essential for foot-ground interaction in humanoids.
